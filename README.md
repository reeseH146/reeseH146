# Main
  Hello, I'm Reese, I want to code things as a hobby and potentially get in a line of work related to this.
  Currently studying and programming, mostly games since they're easy to manage, in my free time.

# Current skills
  Python - Understands good amount of python and game library pygame
  Web Dev - Know a few HTML and CSS commands

# Goals
 - Understand advanced Python, different commonly used libraries and different way python can be applied
 - Learn web dev and be able to make and host my own websites
 - Learn lower level languages such as Rust and Java
 - Somehow wrap my head around GIT and Github so I use it other than Commit, Push and Clone
 - Learn back end and a bit of front end and how to make them interact with each other
